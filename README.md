Will split keyboard input into multiple monophonic voices. When maximum amount of voices is reached (at this point, the maximum is 3 voices,) the next voice will be assigned based on which of the current voices it is closest to. This enables a new way of composing counter melodies for multiple instruments.

Put the device on each channel that needs to be separated.

Choose the number of voices you would like with the buttons on the right.
This will change the number of voices of every other instance of the same device.

Assign each instrument a voice number on the left.

First note you play will go to voice 1.
If you add another note while holding down the first note it will play on voice 2.
And so on.

The maximum is three at the moment.
